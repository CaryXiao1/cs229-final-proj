## models/README.md

This was the folder we used to store different versions of the ViT model. Since the file for the model is too large to be stored on GitHub, we haved saved our moddel trained on the color-agumented dataset in google drive via [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zhGVlrmKj-cU2b4QZA_Zl9baO40GFz1m/view?usp=sharing).
